# Clustering-Based Multi-Characteristic Comparative Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemiology in Europe

This study uses statistical and machine learning tools to analyze potential links between COVID-19 dynamics and various factors across 42 European countries. The analysis involved six categories of country characteristics including COVID-19 incidence, mortality, vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) genetic diversity, pre-pandemic cross-country mobility, and socio-demographic data. Pairwise distances between countries were calculated for each characteristic, and hierarchical clustering trees based on these distances were constructed. This enabled the examination of relationships between the characteristics by comparing the clustering trees. The analysis revealed that COVID-19 incidence is linked with multiple characteristics including population health, VOCs genetic diversity, and socio-demographic parameters. In contrast, mortality was only linked to population health. No strong link was found between mortality and vaccination, while incidence and vaccination were moderately linked. VOC genetic diversity was associated with inter-country mobility and socio-demographic data. These findings indicate that socio-demographic, cultural, and population health characteristics can influence epidemiological dynamics as much as public health interventions and virus variants. They also suggest the need for tailored long-term public health strategies.
